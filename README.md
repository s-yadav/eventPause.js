eventPause.js
=============

eventPause is a tiny plugin with lots of methods to control events. So whenever you want you can pause and activate any event.
<p>jQuery gave us many way to bind events and unbind it.<br>
<br>
But there some situation comes where we just want to pause event (or say unbind  it temporally). For that we unbind events and bind it again when we need. <br>
But this become painful on binding event again when there is no reference of  event handler or you don&rsquo;t have its scope, or you just don&rsquo;t know what event  handlers are assigned to a particular event.</p>
So this plugin will help you there and will give control on events in better way.
